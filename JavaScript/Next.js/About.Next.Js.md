## About Next.js & a Comparison to a stand-alone back-end framework

what do you mean by "next.js is for server side rendering ?", you mean i can't use it for a stand-alone back-end of my web application ?

"Can Next.js be used as a stand-alone back-end or is it only for server-side rendering?"

###### ANSWER

Next.js is a server-rendered React framework that provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering options [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering). Server-side rendering, in particular, means that the HTML of the page is generated on the server for each request, and the generated HTML, JSON data, and JavaScript instructions are then sent to the client [nextjs.org](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering). Therefore, Next.js can be used for back-end development, but it's important to note that it's not a stand-alone back-end for a web application. [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/62690747/next-js-api-is-back-end) explains that Next.js is a pre-rendered React app in the client-side that users can view and interact with, and it also does server-side rendering and API routes which can perform server-side code and access data in the database.In conclusion, Next.js can be used for back-end development with server-side rendering, but it's not a stand-alone back-end for a web application. It's important to understand the capabilities and limitations of Next.js and choose the right technology for your specific project needs.

## Express.js VS Next.js

so as i gathered, next.js is very modern and is used solely for SSR, while express.js is a complete stand-alone back-end framework. is that right ?

"Comparison between Next.js and Express.js for back-end development"

###### ANSWER

Yes, that's correct. Express.js is a stand-alone back-end framework that can be used for building APIs and server-side applications [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69918766/nextjs-vs-express) [mirrorfly.com](https://www.mirrorfly.com/blog/nextjs-vs-expressjs/), while Next.js is primarily a front-end framework that is used for server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering options [mirrorfly.com](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/how-nextjs-works/rendering). Next.js can be used alongside an existing back-end, but it's not a stand-alone back-end for a web application [red-gate.com](https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/development/javascript/express-js-or-next-js-for-your-backend-project/). Therefore, the choice between the two depends on the specific needs of the project, and developers can choose the best one that suits their needs [mirrorfly.com](https://www.mirrorfly.com/blog/nextjs-vs-expressjs/).
