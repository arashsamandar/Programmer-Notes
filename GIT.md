## SSH

> with `SSH Keys` , with ssh keys you don't have to enter __password__ any more :star:

> you may create `ssh keys` in `github`

> with phpstorm you can also create ssh keys to be connected directly to the `server`

## Github

```markdown
git push // you can use git pull to get a repository
git clone // to copy a remote repository into your current folder
```

```
git add . // to add everything in current folder(project)
git commit -m 'i am arash'
```

### .gitignore

> to ignore some files from commiting use :`gitignore` , if this file doesn't exist , make one yourself

> type the file name that you don't want to `git add` , write the file name and extention to the `.gitignore`

```
git add . // now that file wouldn't be included .
```

## exclude from git add and commit

> use the `.gitignore` , write the file name in it .

> to exclude a `folder` type the name with a slash , just like bellow

```
// inside .gitignore
/myfolder
```

> use *.txt to include all text files and as such

## branch

> use `git branch arash_project` , now __arash_project__ is a branch

> use `git checkout arash_project` , to go to the branch

> create a branch with `git branch arash` , now arash is a branch

> to go to a branch type `git checkout arash` , ( now we are in the arash branch )

### important

> when you are in the __arash__ branch , go on and create a file with `touch`.

```markdown
> git branch arash // still in the __master__ branch
> git checkout arash // now in the __arash__ branch

> touch index.html // creates a file index.html while in the arash branch
> git add .
> git commit -m 'login form'

IMPORTANT
	if you come out , out of the branch with __ git checkout master __
	the login would not be there
	
	add the login.html which is in the __ arash branch __ 
	with
> git merge arash

IMPORTANT

	// now the login.html would appear .

```
