# How to Search Google
> Searching `this` or `that` , you can use **`( | )` sign ,** like :
```makefile
best porn | sex sites
```

> searching for **subject** rather than the phrase , using `**( ~ )` sign** ( meaning you want the search to be in a site subject , rather than phrases ) . like :
```makefile
healthy ~ food  // it means search for every site than has content about healthy with the focus or subject about food
```

> search in a `site`
```makefile
// you can eather use it like
best android tutorials site:lynda.com
// or can write
lynda.com best android tutorials .
```

> search in `address`
```makefile
arashSolomon address:facebook.com/GroupName/users/topPlayers
```

> using **`( * )` ,** if you **don't remember** a part of your phrase ( or anything )
```makefile
the number is 11.24*
```

> when forgeting **lots of words .**
> if it's the **lengthier** half of the phrase you can't remember , **rather than a** single key word .
> try writing out the **first** and **last** words and putting `**Around + ( the approximate number of missing words )**`
```makefile
//Example , i'm searching for a Poem , like:
bani adam azaye (2) ke dar afarinesh ze (2)
```

> searching for **range** with `( ... )` sign . like :
```markup
kia optima price $100...$2000
```

> searching in **Titles** or `intitle`  , rather than phrase , by using **intitle**
```makefile
intitle:won the championship
```


> search `inurl` , meaning the word should be in the **URL** .
```makefile
inurl:samandar // samandar bayad tooye ye url estefade shode bashe
```


> using `related` ( if you liked a website verymuch & you wanted to find more sites that are **like** it ) use **related** like :
```makefile
related:www.chess.com
```

> searching when **Order** of the words matters , if you just write the phrase **:** best programmers in the world , google dosn't care the order , **you must use `( " )` .** like :
```makefile
"best programmers in the world"
```

> exclude a word from search result , use `**( - )**` before the world , like :
```makefile
interesting books -buy
```

> finding specific `**filetype**` like :
```markdown
samanar logo filetype:png
```
