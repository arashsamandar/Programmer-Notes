-------

> we're going to cover socket programming with c and it relates to networking basically . the basics of setting up network connections . the basics of setting up network connections using the Tcp protocol with C sockets we could make connections between our applications .

> we will be able to implement `HTTP Sockets Http Protocole Over Sockets` by the time we finish this cource .

## Why Sockets Are Important Network Programming

> `Sockets` are basically the low level connection endpoint , they are the way we can create the connection between any two computers essentially .
>
> and there's a lot of protocols to sit on top of Sockets .
>
> things like `TCP` which is our low level networking protocol . and on top of that is a high level networking protocols `HTTP` ( the protocol that we use when we browse the web ) , and `FTP`, what you might use to upload files .
>
> or in a bunch of cases theres a lot of protocols to sit on top of the basic socket functionality .
>
> so these are some of the reasons why sockets are important .
