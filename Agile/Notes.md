Old Way Of Doing Things ( Software Development ) was `WaterFall` Approach , which is a step wise approach to project development

But in `Agile` All the phases are repeated in every iteration ( Plan - Desing - Develope - Test - Deploy - Review )

> Agile works in small `Sprints` that focuses on Continues Delivery

> Agile is An Umberella for several `Iterative & Incremental` Software evelopment approaches  Like
>
> > Scrum , TDD , FDD , Crystal , and etc ..

Agile Disadvantages : > Team Members Wear Many Hat

> Agile Teams are generally small , so all team members must be knowledgeable about a veriaty of processes along with the `Agile Methodology` Itself

- Less Concrete Planning

- Intense Commitment

- Team Members Wear Many Hats

- Limited Documentation

- Final Product Can Differ

  ## Agile Components

  - Sprint ( also called Iteration )

- User Story

  > like feature , but to the user point of view !
  >
  > self-contained unit of development work that captures a feature or functionality from the perspective of the user. It is designed to ensure that the development team focuses on the value that the feature will provide to the end-user.

- Epic

- Features 

  > Chunk of functionality that delivers Buisiness Value
  >
  > No Feature is described in detail Untill It is Prioritized For A Sprint

- Product Backlog

  > is a single authoritive source that the team works on

- Agile Board

  > an agile board is a visual representation of __Progress__ of a software project.
  >
  > exactly what you had before in work ( like the columns in Trello )
  >
  > agile board is devided into columns : __To Do__ , __In Progress__ , __Testing__ ,__Done__

## Agile Metrics

> :star: should be used by the members of the agile team And Not Outsiders ( they should be evaluated voluntarily by the agile team )

> :star: Important : Use Several Metrics Together To See A Balanced Picture ( As It Is Not A Good Practice To Only Evaluate One Metric as it could sacrifice other aspects ( Other Metrics ))

> :star: Agile metrics should Serve as a Conversation starter ( Not just measure for the sake of measurement 

------

## Scrum Framework

> Addresses Two Important Issues :
>
> 1) Delivery Speed 
> 2) a Flexible way of handling clients ever changing needs

> when you talk about scrum there are three things you should know

1) Roles 
2) Artifacts
3) Events

> How Scrum Works : first in 
>
> 1) Vision : the product owner talks with stakeholders and adds all the requirements as stories in the 
> 2) Product BackLog
> 3) Sprint Backlog : after that teams take a Chunk from the Backlog for the Sprint ( Sprint Backlog ) and a Sprint is Scheduled and Planed in ( Sprint Backlog )
> 4) Sprint Review : Then When Sprint Is Finished time comes for ( Sprint Review ) . then teams work toward it with the help of Scrum Master.  which the target in it is the work that is done and the reviews of users ( or stakeholders )
> 5) Sprint Retrospective : unlike Sprint Review which is about the `Product` <-> the `Sprint Retrospective` is about the `Process`
