# Java Basics



### JAVAC

> **javac** is the primary java compiler included in java development kit (JDK). It takes java program as input and generates java bytecode as output. **javac** saves this compiled bytecode files into .class files

### JVM

> JVM executes the bytecode generated by compiler. This is called program run phase.



### JRE

> JRE is the environment within which the java virtual machine runs. JRE contains Java virtual Machine(JVM), class libraries, and other files excluding development tools such as compiler and debugger. Which means you can run the code in JRE but you can’t develop and compile the code in JRE.



### JDK

> JDK is a superset of JRE, it contains everything that JRE has along with development tools such as compiler, debugger etc.

### Multithreading

> Java supports multithreading. Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program for maximum utilisation of CPU.

----

# Collections and Array

> The Collection in Java is a framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate the group of objects. Java Collections can achieve all the operations that you perform on a data such as searching, sorting, insertion, manipulation, and deletion. Java Collection means a single unit of objects.

### Declare One Dimmentional Array

```java
public int[] array; // declares a new Array
array = new int[10] // One Dimentional Array
// the easy way is
public int arr[] = new int[]{1,2,3,4};

// Two Dimentional Array
public int array[][] = new int[10][];
```

### List Of Implementation Of Collection Interface

- > **List :** Ordered , Duplicates are allowed , indexed

- > **Sets :** Duplicates are not allowed , may or may not be Ordered , sorted for TreeSet and Others

- > **Maps :** Duplicate Keys are not Allowed .

- > **ArrayList :** Fast Iteration Y Fast Random Access ( Basically is the implementation Of **List**

# Data Types

> Data type defines the values that a variable can take, for example if a variable has int data type, it can only take integer values

### we have two categories of data type

1. > **Primitive data types**
2. > **Non-Primitive data types**



> Arrays` and `Strings` and `Objects` in whole are non-primitive data types, we will discuss them later in the coming tutorials



> **NOTE :** Java is a statically typed language. A language is statically typed, if the data type of a variable is known at compile time. This means that you must specify the type of the variable (Declare the variable) before you can use it.



> **NOTE** : It is a good programming practice to declare all the variables ( that you are going to use) in the beginning of the program.

------

### 1) Primitive data types

> In Java, we have eight primitive data types: `boolean`, `char`, `byte`, `short`, `int`, `long`, `float` and `double`. Java developers included these data types to maintain the portability of java as the size of these primitive data types do not change from one operating system to another.



*bye,short,int,long are used to store whole number*

*float and double are used for fractional numbers.*

# Different Variable's Type

### Types of Variables in Java

> There are three types of variables in Java.

- Local variable 
- Static (or class) variable 
- Instance variable

### Static (or class) Variable

> when a variable is declared in a class as `static` , if one instance of that changes , so does all the others . for example :

```java
public class StaticVarExample {
   public static String myClassVar="class or static variable";
	
   public static void main(String args[]){
      StaticVarExample obj = new StaticVarExample();
      StaticVarExample obj2 = new StaticVarExample();
      StaticVarExample obj3 = new StaticVarExample();
      
      //All three will display "class or static variable"
      System.out.println(obj.myClassVar);
      System.out.println(obj2.myClassVar);
      System.out.println(obj3.myClassVar);

      //changing the value of static variable using obj2
      obj2.myClassVar = "Changed Text";

      //All three will display "Changed Text"
      System.out.println(obj.myClassVar);
      System.out.println(obj2.myClassVar);
      System.out.println(obj3.myClassVar);
   }
}
```



> we also can access the static without needing to declare the object

### Instance Variable

> Instance or normal variable , Unlike static variable, instance variables have their own separate copy of instance variable. We have changed the instance variable value using object obj2 in the following program and when we displayed the variable using all three objects, only the obj2 value got changed, others remain unchanged

```java
public class InstanceVarExample {
   String myInstanceVar="instance variable";
   public static void main(String args[]){
   }
}
```

### Local Variable

These variables are declared inside method of the class. Their scope is limited to the method which means that You can’t change their values and access them outside of the method.

----

# Enhanced Loop

> Enhanced for loop is useful when you want to iterate Array/Collections, it is easy to write and understand.

> Example of Enhanced For Loop

```java
int myArray[] = new int[4]{1,2,3,45,11};
int sum = 0;
for(int num : myArray) {
   sum += num;
}
```

----

-----

# Static Class, Block, Member

### Static Block

> Static block is used for initializing the static variables.**This block gets executed when the class is loaded in the memory**. A class can have multiple Static blocks, which will execute in the same sequence in which they have been written into the program.



```java
public class MyAss {
   static {
      int num = 122;
      String name = "arash";
      boolean flag = false;
      char charachter = 'A';
   }
   
   public void Main() {
      // some code in here
   }
}
```

### Java Static Variables

> A static variable is common to all the instances (or objects) of the class because it is a class level variable. In other words you can say that only a single copy of static variable is created and shared among all the instances of the class



**Important NOTE :** *Static variables are also known as Class Variables.*

### **NOTE :** Static Members Issue

> static variables can be accessed in static Methods , however you can not access  normal variables , and you need to access them by an instance of the class , like :



```java
public class Example {
   public static String name = "arash";
   public int number = 20;
   public int age = 30;
   
   public static void myNewMethod() {
      number = 10; // give an error , you should access it like bellow example
   }
   
   public static void myNewOne(Example ex) {
      ex.number = 22;
      name = "shalGHam";
   }
}
```

## Static Class

> **NOTE :** you can define an static class , but only if that class is in another normal class

```java
public class Example {
   public static String name = "arash";
   
   static class OtherExame {
      // can access outer class static members
      public void display() {
         System.out.Println(name);
      }
   }
}
```

# Stream & I/O

## java.io

> This package provides for system input and output through data streams, serialization and the file system

## Stream [Link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/stream-in-java/)

> a stream is a sequence of object that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result 

- *A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.*
- *Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.*
- *Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.*

## The Difference Between A Package & A Jar File In Java

>`Package` is logically classifying/organizing your java classes. Packages were basically introduced so that 2 developers in the same team could create a class with the same name and not cause a conflict because they belonged to different packages/namespaces.

> `JAR` (Java ARchive) is basically physically organizing your classes. One JAR can have many java packages. You can also specify an entrypoint for your application in a JAR. JAR is basically structured like a zip file which archives all of your java packages. JAR will contain all of your .class files, images, properties file etc.

>JAR = Java Archive
>
>is a zipped version of all the classes and its dependent libraries. It is an easy way to deploy the application and also to move it around.

> Package is to group a set of related classes and interfaces.

> `Very Important` : A JAR file can be thought of more like an executive file except for the fact that it requires JVM to execute. You can execute a JAR file by just double clicking over it just like an executive file.

-------

## Using Final Variables

> :memo:NOTE : you can use Final variables in a class that Does not have a value , but you have to use this final variable in the `Class Constructor`

```java
public class Users {
    public final String name;
    public final String family;
    public Users(String name,String family) {
        this.name = name;
        this.family = family;
    }
} // just easy as this
```
