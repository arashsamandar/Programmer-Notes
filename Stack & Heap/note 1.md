## Differences :

- **Memory allocation:** Stack memory is allocated and deallocated automatically, while heap memory is allocated and deallocated manually by the program.
- **Memory layout:** Stack memory is stored in a linear, LIFO order, while heap memory is stored in a more dynamic and flexible way.
- **Data lifetime:** Stack data is typically short-lived and tied to the lifetime of a function call, while heap data can persist across function calls.
- **Access:** Stack data is accessed directly using the stack pointer, while heap data is accessed using pointers to the allocated memory blocks.
