maybe i start with a simpler one .
i want to create a simulation . you know i like this kind of applications .
notice i mean a graphical simulation , it is , or must be fairly simple to implement .  don't you think .
well , not to that extent , but yes , it is not hard for you .
a simple graphical simulation that uses graphic card .
i want this :) , i want , i want , i adore it and i'm passionate about it .
developing a game is has always been cool for me .
specially the ones with simulations , like bridges , like smashing a cube .
like througin a cube through smoke and what the outcome !!
interesting tought you have .
yes , indeed .

### you see , What I Really Want Now , Is a Target , A porpuse .

>`Destruction Type of game`

--------------

> ### here we defined three major concepts that our game should have

- simple
- simulation
- destruction



### thoughts on the details

## how can i benefit from developing such an application ( game ) ?

- > developing an application `makes you smarter in your field as a Programmer`

- > you will learn how to `make your libraries` , as excelent as it sounds for you :) , you like it , don't you ? ofcourse

- > you will start `get used to writing clean codes`

- > `as we start from the very base` , by building just a simple specifications of a break , this means it can lead us to some big archituctur

- > `breaks makes a wall and an entire building` !!
  >
  > better to go in one specific direction than several directions .

  > you will achieve more , you will focus more , and all of these things results in a better result.
