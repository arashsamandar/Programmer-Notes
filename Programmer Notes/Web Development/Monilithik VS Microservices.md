## Monolitic Approach

> as you see bellow , they are all part of the same system . with the same database , on the same server . with the same FileSystem

## What a Microservice is

> Above Diagram was just one Way Off building Web Application , another way is by using microservices .
>
> *what a microservice is ?* , is that it is an architechture , where every feature is its own application .
>
> every part is its own application .
>
> like imagine the above diagram . where the circle is the main application .
>
> now in the microservice diagram . every one of them . is a circle . and not all of them in the same circle . all of them seperate .
>
> they are all in there own server . and if you wonder how they connect to each other , they connect using `API`

## cons of Monolitic apps

> if they are not well written , one curropt part , can have a domino effect on the others .
